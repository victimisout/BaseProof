# BaseProof

BaseProof is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to prove the existence and integrity of documents using the Base blockchain. It stores the hash of a document on-chain, which can later be used to verify its authenticity.

## Features
- Upload any file to store its hash on the Base blockchain.
- Verify document authenticity by comparing file hashes.
- Low gas fees using Base Layer-2.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Truffle
- Metamask (for interacting with the dApp)
